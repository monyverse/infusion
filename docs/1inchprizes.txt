About
1inch provides a suite of powerful tools that enable developers to build smooth DeFi experiences on Ethereum, Ethereum L2s, and beyond. Hackers can utilize our open-source SDKs, smart contract protocols, and robust APIs to build onchain applications. In this hackathon, we are giving builders three distinct challenges:
* Build applications with extensive use of 1inch API
* Extend our Limit Order protocol with creative trading strategies for users
* Expand the reach of 1inch Cross-chain Swap (Fusion+) to one of the following EVM and non-EVM chains: Sui, Aptos, Bitcoin/Bitcoin cash/Doge/Litecoin, Tron, Ton, Monad, Near, Starknet, Cardano, Stellar, XRP Ledger, ICP, Tezos, Polkadot, EOS, or Cosmos.

About
Etherlink is a high-performance, EVM-compatible Layer 2 built on the Tezos blockchain. Designed with developers in mind, Etherlink combines low fees, fast finality, and institutional-grade security — making it ideal for DeFi applications and real-world use cases.
Built using Tezos Smart Rollups and powered by a decentralized Data Availability Layer (DAL), Etherlink provides a scalable and efficient environment for deploying Solidity-based smart contracts using familiar tools like Hardhat, Foundry, and MetaMask.
Key features include:
• EVM compatibility: Deploy and interact with smart contracts using standard Ethereum tooling.
• High throughput, low latency: Optimized for fast transaction finality.
• Affordable gas fees: Build and scale without high operational costs.
• Decentralized and upgradeable: Built on Tezos, one of the most battle-tested blockchains in production.
⸻
Why Build on Etherlink?
• Performance: DeFi apps run smoothly with near-instant execution and high transaction capacity.
• Trustworthy foundation: Etherlink inherits the governance and decentralization guarantees of Tezos.
• Easy onboarding: Use existing Ethereum codebases, infrastructure, and developer tools.
• Supportive ecosystem: Receive direct support from the Etherlink team during the hackathon and beyond.
Whether you’re porting an existing DApp or launching something entirely new, Etherlink gives you a solid, future-proof base to build on.

$3,000
🥉
3rd place
$2,000
Build a prototype that integrates Etherlink with the 1inch Fusion+ protocol, enabling token swaps via 1inch routed through Etherlink’s Layer 2 network. This can include routing logic, custom smart contracts, bridges, or price oracle adaptations needed to make Fusion+ compatible with Etherlink.
You can also explore adjacent tools or infrastructure that help facilitate cross-chain routing, asset bridging, or composability between Etherlink and Ethereum.
Qualification Requirements
To qualify for a prize, submissions must:
1. Deploy on Etherlink using Solidity (EVM-compatible) smart contracts.
2. Demonstrate how your project integrates or extends 1inch Fusion+ on Etherlink.
3. Include a clear README with instructions on:
• How to run or test the code
• What components were built or modified
• Which 1inch protocol features were used or extended
4. Be submitted before the ETHGlobal Unite deadline and presented during judging.
5. Be original work created during the hackathon.
Bonus points for:
• Technical depth and practical utility
• Working UI or CLI to demonstrate integration
• Clear potential for future development or 1inch partnership

About
Stellar is an open-source blockchain network designed for fast, low-cost cross-border payments and asset tokenization. Built with a unique consensus algorithm called the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), it can process thousands of transactions per second with settlement times of 3-5 seconds and fees typically under a penny. The network natively supports multi-currency transactions and atomic swaps, making it particularly well-suited for financial applications, remittances, and creating programmable digital representations of real-world assets.

About
NEAR Protocol is a scalable blockchain platform that enables seamless cross-chain development through Chain Abstraction. The Shade Agent Framework allows developers to build secure decentralized agents in Trusted Execution Environments, while Chain Signatures enable multi-chain interactions and NEAR Intents simplify user experiences across different blockchain networks.
Prizes
🔗 Best 1inch Fusion+ Solver Built with NEAR's Shade Agent Framework ⸺ $10,000


Up to 2 teams will receive $5,000
Build a decentralized solver that integrates with 1inch Fusion+ for cross-chain swaps using NEAR's Shade Agent Framework and Trusted Execution Environment.
---
There is an existing decentralized NEAR Intents solver here:
Solver manager and deployer https://github.com/Near-One/tee-solver/
Solver https://github.com/think-in-universe/near-intents-tee-amm-solver/tree/feat/tee-solver
---
It listens for intents, generates quotes, and submits them for execution on NEAR Intents. Your task is to build a similar system that works with 1inch Fusion+ and its meta-order format. Make sure the solver is created using NEAR’s Shade Agent Framework and is deployed in a Trusted Execution Environment.
---
The Shade Agent Framework allows you to build decentralized solvers, enabling users to delegate and provide liquidity to solvers without requiring trust that the solver will behave correctly or having to set up their own solver.
Qualification Requirements
Your solver must listen for quote requests (mocked or real), produce valid 1inch Fusion meta-orders using NEAR's Chain Signatures, include comprehensive documentation with setup instructions, and demonstrate end-to-end functionality. Bonus points for modular architecture that extends to other protocols.
