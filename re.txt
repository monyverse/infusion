Integrating non-EVM chains

PRIMARY GOAL

1. Manage the HTLC and communication between an EVM CHAIN and your non-EVM chain (all CLI/testnet is ok!)
  - Properly handle hashlock logic
  - Properly handle contract expiration/reverts
2. Swaps must bi-directional  

EVM side 

1 inch Escrow Factory <---> 1inch Escrow

<:::::Cross-chain orchestration:::::>

non-EVM side 

implement an escrow contract on whatever non-evm chain

Integrating non-EVM chains

- UI
- Enable partial fills
- Relayer and Resolver
- Base/Abitrum/etc <-> mainnet non-EVM

iNTEGRATION non-EVM chains

- Do not post any orders to 1inch REST APISs

Qualification Requirements: 

- Preserve hashlock and timelock functionality for the non-EVM implementation
- Swap functionality should be bidirectional (swaps should be possible to and from Ethereum)
- Onchain (mainnet/L2 or testnet) execution of token transfers should be presented during the final demo (EVM testnets will require the deployment of Limit Order Protocol contracts)
- 
Stretch goals (not hard requirements):
- UI
- Enable partial fills
